The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured process for 
creating software, encompassing stages like planning, requirement 
analysis, system design, coding, testing, deployment, maintenance, and 
retirement. It starts with project initiation and requirement gathering, 
followed by system design, where the software's architecture is defined. 
Then, the actual coding takes place, followed by rigorous testing to 
ensure functionality and quality. Once approved, the software is deployed, 
and ongoing maintenance and updates are performed until it's retired. The 
specific SDLC model used may vary based on project requirements.
